# The one sample t test compares the mean of your sample data to a known value.

# For example, you might want to know how your sample mean compares to the 
# population mean. You should run a one sample t test when you donâ€™t know the 
# population standard deviation or you have a small sample size. 

# Assumptions for the one-sample T-test

# Data is independent.
# Data is collected randomly.
# Although the parent population does not need to be normally distributed, 
# the distribution of the population of sample means is assumed to be normal

# The parametric test called t-test is useful for testing those samples whose 
# size is less than 30. The reason behind this is that if the size of the sample 
# is more than 30, then the distribution of the t-statistic and the normal 
# distribution will be indistinguishable.

# Note that sample size < 30
